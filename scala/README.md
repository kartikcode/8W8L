# Algorithm implementation using Scala
The above files contain solutions I scripted while learning Scala.
The problems have been taken from the classic [S-99](http://aperiodic.net/phil/scala/s-99/) problemset.This contains some really
cool stuff for you to practice (actually, learn) Scala.

#### Note:
I have only implemented the functions pertaining to the problems. You can either run it directly on some online IDE for Scala
like [ScalaFiddle](https://scalafiddle.io/) (the one I used) or for compiling it on your local machine, you'll have to define an 
object too 'cause Scala uses JVM ;).
